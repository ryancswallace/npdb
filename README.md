# npdb

npdb is an implementation of NumPy-compatible large n-dimenstional arrays stored on disk that may not fit in memory. npdb implements the core multi-dimensional array class `npdb.dbarray`, which provides persistent storage and segmented in-memory operations. `np.dbarray` types support a subset of the `numpy.ndarray` interface.

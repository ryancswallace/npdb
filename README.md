# npdb

npdb is an implementation of large disk-stored NumPy-compatible n-dimenstional arrays that may exceed available memory. npdb implements the core multi-dimensional array class `npdb.dbarray`, which supports persistent storage and parallelized batch processed operations. `npdb.dbarray` supports a subset of the `numpy.ndarray` interface.
